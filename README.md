# Welcome to Sportec Ingestion Application

## **Useful commands**

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## **Overview**

The application processes football data, currently with guaranteed support for the following events:

* `goal`: records a goal, with the scoring team being the one present in the 'team' field.
* `foul`: records a foul, with the team committing the foul indicated in the 'team' field.
* `startMatch`: records the start of the match, performing an initial load into the tables with zeroed metrics if they don't exist for the teams and the match.
* `endMatch`: records the end of the match, calculating at this moment which team was the winner based on the goal count.


### **Infra and data flow**

The application follows the following flow:

1. Data ingestion API: entry point for match events.
2. API <-> Lambda Integration: processes, transforms, and stores the data in the events table.
3. DynamodbStream (Events): whenever something is inserted/updated in the events table, a message is triggered in the table's data stream.
4. Stream <-> Lambda: processes, transforms, and stores the data from the data stream into two separate statistics tables, one for teams and one for matches. The filter for this integration is: event_name === "INSERT" and dynamodb.NewImage.event_type in [goal, foul, startMatch, endMatch]
5. Data output API: matches, their events, and statistics related to teams and matches are accessible through this API.


## **How to deploy**

### System Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Conta AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

### Setup :hammer:

1. Install project dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Create access credentials: [wiki](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)

3. Configure and authorize cli aws

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

4. Bootstrap your aws account (if you haven't already done it)

    ```bash
    cdk bootstrap
    ```

### Deploy :rocket

```bash
cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

If everything went well, the application is now available.
**The API url is shown in the terminal at the end of the deploy.**

### Cleaning :bomb

```bash
cdk destroy
```

## **API**

Note: Always **content-type json/application**

### Event ingestion (POST /ingest)

This endpoint performs validations and data transformations during its use, this may vary according to the type of event being sent.

NOTE:
Currently, if a payload with an event_type other than those below is sent, it will be inserted into the database without validation, but it will not trigger any statistical trigger.

EVENTS:

## Design decisions

* Field removal *ball_possession_percentage*:  

The field was removed due to the non-existence of any event that indicates the resumption of the ball in order to calculate the time of possession.

## Improvement points

### Data ingestion validation

* Ensure each match_id only represents 2 teams
* Create more comprehensive validations for the timestamp

### Stream Processing

* Implement batchprocess to avoid batch loss due to an error in an item.
* Fanout of bad posts

### Data display

* Match listing pagination needs to be improved.

### CI/CD and testing

* CI/CD is not currently developed for automatic testing and deployment.
